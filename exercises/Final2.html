          <p>The experience of reading goes hand-in-hand with epistemology. Regardless of differing views of what knowledge counts or where it is located, the antecedent to each one of those questions is access. The codex provides access and means of approach that the scroll, by production, simply cannot provide. The page emerges as a unit of perception, and readers are able to leaf through a clearly articulated text, one that eventually included differentiated words (that is, words separated by spaces), paragraphs, and chapters, along with table of contents, indexes, and other readering aids. One may argue that these aids can also be added to the scroll format and that is partially true. However, with the exception of differentiated words, access to these other aids would not be as seamless and intuitive as they are in the codex format. </p>
          <p>An example of these aids can be seen through the reproduction of Ab&uacute Mans&uacuter al-M&aacutetur&iacuted&iacute (d.333/944) interpretation of the Quran, titled Taw&iacutel&aacutet al-Qur&aacuten, which is regarded as the earliest reason-based (dir&aacuteyah) exegesis. This early important work has been published a few times, partially and completely with editors using a few manuscripts, but the Turkish D&aacuter al-M&iacutez&aacuten (Mizan Yayunevi) edition has certain salient features that distinguish it as being the foremost edition thus far. It is a 19 volume publication which includes one volume of introduction and selected translation in Turkish and one volume of indexes and has taken certain necessary steps to ensure a well-edited publication. The editors had many manuscripts at their disposal that previous editors did not which solved many textual errors that plagued previous editions. Their methodology included looking over the different manuscripts and noting the differences in the marginalia. This is a great feature of the commentary/super-commentary (sharh/hashiyah) genre.
          </p>
          <p>Arguably the greatest feature of this edition is the partial inclusion of Sharh Taw&iacutel&aacutet al-Qur&aacuten by Al&aacute al-D&iacuten al-Samarqand&iacute (d.450/1145). If this were a scroll format, his explanations would have had to fit on the side of the page or in between lines which can distract and disorient the reader when they are of immense magnitude. In codex form, the additional material presented by the commentator and editors, allows the reader to see “the meeting of minds” and this would seem ephemeral in scroll form due to its limited usability. In addition to the Sharh, the editors also elucidated perplexing phrases and words, included brief descriptions of relatively enigmatic people and places, and intuitive indexes.  Each volume includes an index on verses cited, an index on narrations, an index on individuals referenced, an index on tribes and places, an index on religious groups and sects, an index on poetry, an index on books, and an index on technical terms and primary themes. Once again, access to these indexes and marginalia inclusions for readers and researchers would be quite cumbersome, if not impossible, had it been in scroll format.
