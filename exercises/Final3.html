          <p>The codex as a device provides epistemic usability whereas scrolls, even with hypertext and other virtual features, simply is not up to par when engaging in serious reading. Even with the major technological changes, the codex form has sustained due to user preference and being able to readjust based on the information landscape. Paging, as opposed to scrolling, disseminates knowledge more effectively and coherently. An example of that can be seen through religious texts; by the third century AD, the codex became crucial to the spread of Christianity. Technology has taken portability to the next level and users can choose whether to scroll or page. But yet it is seen that when users want to engage with knowledge in a comprehending manner, they choose the codex format - a testament to its bestowal of permanence on a text, and its accessibility and readability and affordability. </p>
          <p>In conclusion, this paper aims to distinguish the overall benefits of codexes over scrolls mainly stemming from how users perceive knowledge. That being stated, the historical roll that scrolls have played in developing the literacy of human beings cannot be understated. The orality-to-literacy shift could not have occurred without advancements made to scrolls and scrolling. Modern scholarship is characterized by its ability to organize and arrange traditions of thought in a manner that is both amenable to rational presentation and pedagogic or didactic use. There exists an obvious relationship between what users perceive as knowledge and what format it is presented to them in. It has been argued in this paper that the codex format allows for the inclusion of aids continuously whereas the scroll format, though continuous in nature, rolls into oblivion due to the interruption of perception or lack thereof. The very structure of the codex form sought to bring stability to text, previously anarchic and still is, by providing something as simple as a page, an accepted unit of textual organization and perception. Reading aids that are taken for granted like page numbers and chapter headings were developed and elaborated with the codex in mind as the current and future layout of the book. The didactic footing that books currently enjoy stems from scrolls advancing into codexes, and codexes becoming more and more intricate to provide better accessibility and complex readability. Books, as objects of aesthetic beauty and as carriers of human knowledge, are better reflected in codex form as extensions or embodiments of human institutions.
