          <p>Content may be the key ingredient that brings readers to the table-spread but the aesthetics do enhance the reading process. The king of aesthetics is materiality and with advancements in technology, it has become abundantly clear that materiality is no longer limited to physical substances like paper, wood, stone, and steel. Materiality, along with other factors like social change and idealogical preferences, governs the way people perceive, disseminate, and evaluate the truth they read and comprehend. Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren have exquisitely given a baseball parable to represent the relationship between the writer, text, and reader in their classic work How to Read a Book in which they state:</p>
           <blockquote> "The pitcher or batter is the giver here in the sense that his activity initiates the motion of 			the ball. The catcher or fielder is the receiver in the sense that his activity terminates it. 			Both are equally active, though the activities are distinctly different. If anything is passive 	here, it is the ball; it is pitched and caught. It is the inert thing which is written and read, 			like the ball, is the passive object common to the two activities which begin and terminate	the process."</blockquote>
          <p> The ball has changed throughout history but two key types have played a dynamic epistemological role, the scroll and the codex. This paper aims to discuss how these two formats, scrolls and codexes, construct for users reading material and their perception, dissemination, and evaluation of knowledge. This paper also argues that the codex format, physical or otherwise, is better for readers overall due to how it  influences epistemology because of the method in which readers use, digest, read, and store textual and visual information. </p>
          <p>There are definite advantages of modern scrolling. The ability to reduce large quantities of information into handheld sizes and the capability to gradually reveal information with an interactive toolbar are amongst the most apparent benefits. But is the ease of access simply a deception of information? How do minds retain material that is presented in scroll format? Sanchez and Wiley have conducted research on how scrolling affects WMC (working memory capacity) and have concluded stating:</p>
          <blockquote>"Our results indicated that scrolling negatively affects learning from text, and this effect is most pronounced in learners who have lower WMC. Across two studies, these learners 			were less able to develop a casual understanding of a complex topic when presented with 			a scrolling interface than when presented the same information units in discrete pages. On 	the other hand, scrolling had little impact on higher-WMC learners." </blockquote>
          <p>The research shows that reading by scrolling negatively impacts comprehension. The end of a page and a start of a new one aids minds, especially low-WMC readers, in digesting information. On the other hand, if comprehension is not vital, such as in the case of some recitals or entertainment, presenting information on a scroll format may have its benefits due to its fluidity. A simple YouTube search of artists scrolling on their phones while reading lyrics show how this feature allows them to keep their rhythm and flow. But the functionality of reading, as it relates to epistemology, has to do with effective search and identification. The construct of the codex format is more conducive for reading which will involve cross-referencing, making links by association, skimming, scanning, taking into account the visual identity of a text and the impact of the white space that surrounds it. Granting the fact that codex and scroll formats exist in both digital and print mediums, the advantages listed above extend from tangibility and immediate physicality, which are less applicable in non-physical forms, even though modern technological features do try to mimic the above mentioned traits of reading.</p>
