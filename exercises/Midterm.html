          <p> <b> Procedures: </b> </p>
          <p>Step 1 - Arrive on time since the best materials are usually available early. Register for the possibility to be granted early entry. </p>
          <p>Step 2 - Due to safety protocols, only 25 people will be allowed to browse and shop for materials at a time. You may reserve your spot on the app in order to secure entry at the time you plan to come in. </p>
          <p>Step 3 - Explore, read, and discover.   </p>
          <p> <b> Safety Guidelines </b> </p>
          <p> Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only allow 25 customers into the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered tickets that are given out from 8 to 11 am. Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside. </p>
          <p> <b> Where does your money go? </b> </p>
          <p> As volunteers of the library, we are able to give 100% of the proceeds back to the library. This cycle of funds is one that we hope will facilitate and further library services. This reciprocity of knowledge drives our volunteering efforts and can be tangibly noticed in the fact that we do not charge any sales tax and intangibly sensed through the smiles underneath our masks. </p>
