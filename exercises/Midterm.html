          <p>Drop by and checkout out our vast collection of material for all ages. We have a variety of books, DVDs, magazines and so much more.</p>
          <blockquote> "A house without books is like a room without windows." </blockquote>
          <p> Location: </p>
          <p> Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center.</p>

          <p> -   Gift certificates on sale in $5 denominations.</p>
          <p> Procedures: </p>
          <p>Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book rooms. Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line. If you donâ€™t arrive in time to get a ticket, please just join the latter part of the line.  </p>
          <p> Safety Guidelines</p>
          <p> Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered tickets that are given out from 8 to 11 am. Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside. </p>
          <p> Where does your money go? </p>
          <p> While some booksellers may pledge a portion of your purchase to help local libraries, we give 100% and that truly is the epitome of knowledge reciprocity. Plus, we charge no sales tax at all.
